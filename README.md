# ðŸ§  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) â€“ Iris Classification

## Overview
This document outlines the essential steps involved in implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying iris flower species using the Iris dataset.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Load the Dataset
Load the `Iris.csv` dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis. This allows access to feature values and corresponding class labels for each flower sample.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Preprocess the Data
Prepare the dataset by:
- Removing irrelevant columns (e.g., `Id`)
- Separating input features (`X`) from the target labels (`y`)
- Normalizing feature values to ensure all features contribute equally to distance calculations in the KNN algorithm

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Split the Dataset
Divide the data into training and testing subsets. Typically, 80% of the data is allocated for training, and 20% for testing. This ensures the model is evaluated on unseen data.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Train the KNN Classifier
Initialize the KNN classifier with an appropriate value of `k` (e.g., 3). Train the model using the training data so that it can learn the spatial relationships between different data points.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Make Predictions
Use the trained KNN model to predict the species of iris flowers in the test set. The algorithm identifies the `k` nearest neighbors and assigns the majority class to the test instance.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Evaluate the Model
Assess the modelâ€™s performance by calculating its accuracy on the test set. Additionally, generate a confusion matrix to analyze classification performance across the different iris species.
